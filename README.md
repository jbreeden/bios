I wrote this tiny library to ease the creation of small, cli based, interactive applications on the node platform.
My experience with existing libraries was less than pleasant for that purpose. My needs were small, so this library 
is small. That said, I would be happy to extend it to meet the needs of other users. Pull requests will - of course -
be the simplest way to introduce new features, but I would happily accept issue submissions by users as well.
